WemaCARE is an AI-powered mobile application that revolutionizes healthcare access across Africa by intelligently connecting patients to appropriate specialists through multi-modal symptom analysis. Our solution addresses Africa's critical healthcare crisis (where only 2.3 healthcare workers serve per 1000 population compared to 24.8 in America), and a projected 6.1 million healthcare worker shortage by 2030 threatens millions of lives.
Using Gemini 2.5 Flash for comprehensive multi-modal analysis, the app processes patient inputs via text, voice notes, and images in 15+ African languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic, French, Arabic). Google's advanced AI models extract medical keywords/symptoms and match patients with specialized doctors and healthcare facilities, while also taking into consideration their medical history, based on proximity, availability, and cost considerations. For offline scenarios, we integrate Gemma 3 open-source models optimized for on-device processing. Unlike most generic medical apps designed for Western contexts, WemaCARE integrates African disease patterns, cultural sensitivities, and works in areas with limited connectivity.
